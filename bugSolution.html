```html
<div class="flex">
  <div class="bg-red-500 p-4 w-1/2 flex-grow"></div>
  <div class="bg-blue-500 p-4 w-1/2 flex-grow"></div>
</div>
```
The solution involves adding the `flex-grow` utility class to each div. This ensures that each div equally shares the available space within the flex container, achieving the desired 50% width for each element.
